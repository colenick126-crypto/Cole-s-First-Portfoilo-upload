<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a resilient and analytical learner whose journey has been shaped by both academic rigor and personal curiosity.
</p><br/>
  <p>I began my education at<a href="https://www.africa2trust.com/Member/ServiceMore.aspx?cid=154&sid=14372&id=1534">City Parents' primary School</a> where I built a strong foundation in discipline and excellence. At <a href="https://ugandamartyrs.ac.ug/">Uganda Martyrs' SS Namugongo</a> , I consistently performed among the top of my class, excelling in subjects that demanded critical thinking and creativity. My results reflected not only hard work but also a determination to pursue knowledge with depth and clarity.</p><br/>
  <p>These experiences prepared me for the challenges of higher education, where I continue to balance ambition with strategy—whether in academic planning, football analysis, or linguistic exploration. My performance across schools is not just a record of grades; it is a testament to resilience, adaptability, and a drive to master every domain I engage with.
